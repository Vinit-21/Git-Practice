2. Hi This is new branch file.So far local.


4. Before this the new line added online in File1.txt fetched from github and then merged
	-git fetch orig newbranch
		(newbranch --> branchname) 
	-git merge orign/newbranch
 
Added this line offline and then pushed to newbranch.Also added numbers to line in sequential fashion.
 
5. Now I will pull the newbranch and try to rebase with master(local). [Line Added Online].
